### *About code:*
```
We use Advanced Command Handler, Event Handler so that index.js Dosn't look messy.  
```


## *Commonly asked questions:*

```
1) commands not working
A. There could be several reasons, but we suggest to check and match params from events/guild/message.js to your code.

exanple: execute(client message, args, cmd, Discord)

note: we also want you to remember to use async to avoid erros when using await in your code.
